1. [🛠️ Prerequisites](#-prerequisites)
2. [🔰 Beginner Level](#-beginner-level)
3. [📈 Intermediate Level](#-intermediate-level)
4. 🚀 Advanced Level
5. 🏆 Expert Level

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Basic Kotlin syntax
- Understanding of functions and lambdas
- Familiarity with collections and higher-order functions

## 🔰 Beginner Level

### 1. Introduction to Coroutines
   - What are coroutines?
   - Why use coroutines?
   - Coroutines vs Threads
   - Suspending functions

### 2. First Coroutine
   - `launch` builder
   - `runBlocking`
   - `delay()` vs `Thread.sleep()`
   - CoroutineScope

### 3. Coroutine Builders
   - `launch` vs `async`
   - `withContext`
   - `coroutineScope` builder

### 4. Cancellation & Timeouts
   - Cancelling coroutines
   - Timeout handling
   - Cooperative cancellation

```kotlin
// Example: Basic coroutine
fun main() = runBlocking {
    launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("Hello from coroutine!")
    }
    println("Hello from main thread")
}
```

## 📈 Intermediate Level

### 1. Coroutine Context & Dispatchers
   - Dispatchers (Main, IO, Default, Unconfined)
   - Switching contexts
   - Thread confinement

### 2. Exception Handling
   - try/catch in coroutines
   - CoroutineExceptionHandler
   - SupervisorJob
   - SupervisorScope

### 3. Flows
   - Introduction to Flows
   - Cold vs Hot streams
   - Operators (map, filter, transform)
   - Flow context and thread management

### 4. Channels
   - Basic channel operations
   - Channel types (Rendezvous, Buffered, Conflated)
   - Producers and actors

```kotlin
// Example: Flow
fun simple(): Flow<Int> = flow {
    for (i in 1..3) {
        delay(100)
        emit(i)
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Advanced Level

### 1. StateFlow & SharedFlow
   - State management
   - StateFlow vs LiveData
   - SharedFlow configuration
   - StateFlow vs SharedFlow

### 2. Coroutine Testing
   - Testing suspending functions
   - Test dispatchers
   - Time control in tests

### 3. Coroutine Patterns
   - Structured concurrency
   - Error handling patterns
   - Resource management

### 4. Performance Optimization
   - Coroutine performance characteristics
   - Memory management
   - Profiling coroutines

## 🏆 Expert Level

### 1. Deep Dive into Coroutine Internals
   - Continuation Passing Style (CPS)
   - Coroutine state machine
   - Bytecode analysis

### 2. Custom Coroutine Context
   - Creating custom dispatchers
   - Thread-local data
   - Coroutine context inheritance

### 3. Advanced Flow Operations
   - Custom flow operators
   - Flow error handling strategies
   - Flow testing

### 4. Coroutines in Multiplatform
   - Cross-platform coroutines
   - Native and JS targets
   - Platform-specific implementations
